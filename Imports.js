// Chalk:
// I chose to import chalk because its very simple and yet effective in showing the demonstration of an NPM module import, also because my friend Riley noticed that the colors import was mentioned and that this was a good alternative.

import chalk from "chalk"

console.log(chalk.red('Hello World!')) // this will print Hello World! in red, blue, and green
console.log(chalk.blue('Hello World!'))
console.log(chalk.green('Hello World!'))
